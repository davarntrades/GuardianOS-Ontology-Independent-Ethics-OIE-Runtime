# GuardianOS-Ontology-Independent-Ethics-OIE-Runtime
Integrity-as-a-Service™ for the Next Alignment Epoch  GuardianOS introduces a new class of AI architecture where integrity is structural, not behavioral. Instead of relying on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or surface-level guardrails, GuardianOS embeds alignment, coherence, drift detection, and ethical invariants directly into the runtime.
